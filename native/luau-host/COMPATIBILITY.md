# Native compatibility contract

`Luau.Unity` and `luau_host` are one compatibility unit. The Stage 6 host ABI
is exactly **2.0**: both major and minor must match the managed declarations,
record layouts, type tags, required feature mask, export allowlist, upstream
revision hash, and host build fingerprint. Prefix/minor-forward compatibility
is not claimed because no independently versioned native consumer exists.

ABI compatibility is separate from compiler/bytecode identity. ABI 2.0 defines
the C calling contract; persistent bytecode is accepted only when its compiler
identity matches the exact pinned upstream revision and host input fingerprint.
Changing the compiler options, upstream Luau commit, host sources, reference
token implementation, header, or export allowlist changes that fingerprint
even when the ABI record layout remains 2.0.

Reference tokens are positive process-unique `int32_t` values allocated
monotonically and never reused. Exhaustion is permanent for the process and is
reported as `LUAU_HOST_STATUS_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. Callback registration IDs are
copied into native closure metadata and observed only during the corresponding
active callback. GC interrupt notifications are observation-only. Destructor
callbacks may only release or enqueue their opaque token and must not call the
host, block, allocate substantially, access Unity APIs, or unwind.
