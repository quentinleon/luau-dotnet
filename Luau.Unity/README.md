# Luau.Unity

Luau.Unity embeds the official Luau VM behind a bounded managed API for Unity.
It supports editor-authored `.luau` assets, verified first-party bytecode, and
untrusted source-based modding without exposing the native stack or VM handle.

This package is a preview. Version `0.2.0` freezes its first release candidate
API and native ABI, but later preview releases may still contain reviewed
breaking changes.

## Install

In Package Manager, choose **Add package from git URL** and use the exact tag:

```text
https://github.com/Quantum-Lion-Labs/Luau-Unity.git?path=Luau.Unity#v0.2.0
```

The package ID is `com.qll.luau.unity`. Luau.Unity is developed by
[Quantum Lion Labs](https://github.com/Quantum-Lion-Labs), the studio behind
NervBox.

## One ordinary Unity workflow

Create a `.luau` file in `Assets`, assign the imported `LuauAsset`, and execute
it through the shared bounded compiler lane. Keep the returned
`LuauResultScope` and state in `using` declarations so disposable VM-backed
results are released deterministically. A returned child thread is a shared
cached `LuauState` wrapper and is disposed separately after all holders finish.

```csharp
using Luau;
using Luau.Unity;
using UnityEngine;

public sealed class LuauExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] LuauAsset script;

    async void Start()
    {
        using var state = LuauUnity.CreateState();
        using var results = await state.ExecuteAsync(script, destroyCancellationToken);
        Debug.Log(results[0].Read<long>());
    }
}
```

`LuauUnity.CreateState()` supplies finite defaults and captures Unity's current
synchronization context. Create it on the Unity thread. A root owns all child
threads, VM-backed values, capabilities, module cache entries, and operations;
dispose the root last.

The importer is source-only by default. First-party precompile is an explicit
project policy and still requires runtime artifact authentication. Import
admission is separate from runtime mod-source limits.
